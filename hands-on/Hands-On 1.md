1. Download the .csv file from the Org Info tab. This is a weekly employee update file from Human Resources. This file contains records for 6 employees. Three employees are new hires and three employees are existing employees who have updated information in the file. Org1 currently contains information for existing employees.

2. Upload the comma-separated values file into Org1. Do NOT select the automatic activation or password/Identity Provider options on the Import Users from CSV screen. If the import generates an error, you should identify the cause of the error and correct it so that all records in the file are imported.

3. Activate the account in Org1 for Susan Allard.

4. Create a custom user type and name it Intern. Throughout this exam, if you are instructed to create and name something like a group, policy, or rule, be sure to name it exactly as specified in the instructions. The name should be spelled correctly and have the same case as the instructions.

7. Using the Department attribute of Engineering, define logic in Okta to filter users with this attribute defined into the Engineering Group.
