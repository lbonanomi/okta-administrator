## An Okta Administrator has installed the Okta Radius server agent on a server. After the administrator configures VPN service on this server, a user reports problems while authenticating. The authentication logs show an issue with a malformed username, even though the user has entered it correctly.
## Is this a possible cause for the issue?

The VPN server is using MSCHAPv2 instead of PAP authentication YES
UDP Port 1812 is not opened between the Radius server and the VPN gateway NO
