## Is this the expected behavior when an incremental import from an Active Directory (AD) integration is performed?

<details>
  <summary>Updated and created AD users since the last import are brought into Okta</summary>
<p>
  Yes
</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Only the changed attributes of AD users since the last import are brought into Okta</summary>
<p>
  No
</p>
</details>
