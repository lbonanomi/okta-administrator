## Workday is the profile source for Okta and Okta provisions users to Active Directory. The usernames from Workday have this format: user@abc.com. An Okta Administrator is tasked with provisioning users to AD with a different User Principal Name (UPN) of user@xyz.com.
## Is this how an administrator can accomplish the task?

Use attribute level mastering to assign UPN from AD NO
Modify the profile source priority to make AD the primary profile source and Workday the secondary profile source. NO
Use attribute mapping and Okta Expression Language to change the domain for the UPN in Profile Editor YES
