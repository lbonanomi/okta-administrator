## In an Okta org, there are two profile sources: Active Directory (AD) and Workday. Workday must be the profile source for Title.<br>Is this the correct action for the Okta Administrator to take?

Make Workday the highest directory profile source in Okta.
On the Okta user profile, set Active Directory as the source for the Title attribute.
On the Workday user profile, set Okta as the source for the Title attribute.
On the Okta user profile, set the Title attribute to map from Workday.
