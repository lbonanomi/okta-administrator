## An Okta Administrator is trying to find events in which the end user was allowed access and the sign-in request was evaluated as suspicious by ThreatInsight.
## Is this a valid query the administrator can use to filter the System Log to find these events?

eventType eq "security.threat.detected" or debugContext.debugData.threatSuspected eq "true" NO
eventType eq "security.threat.detected" and outcome.result eq "ALLOW" YES
eventType eq “security.attack.start” and outcome.result ne "ALLOW" NO
